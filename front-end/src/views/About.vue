    <h1>About Small Means:</h1>
    <p>The idea for this site came from a combination of things. The first being one of my favorite scriptures in 1 Nephi 16:29, which reads,"And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things." I believe that some of the
      greatest things we do in life will come about because of the small habits that we form and consistently do throughout our lives.</p>
    <p>The second reason for building this site came from reading the book <em>Atomic Habits</em>. In this book, I learned the importance of making it easy to accomplish and track your habits. I thought the best way to make habit tracking easy was to
      build a web app that allowed simple, quick, and easy habit tracking. I hope you enjoy tracking your habits on the site and that you find inspiration, support, and accountability through the shared habits page.</p>
